#### Bluetooth Communication Using Serial Port

The company I work for has sensors with Bluetooth capabilities

The intention of this Webpage was to create a stand-alone, self-contained WebApp to communicate with the sensors through any device, mainly mobile devices.

I did get it to work on Desktop PCs. At the moment, Chrome has no support for Comm Ports on mobile devices. I tried hacking a virtual server with a virtual Comm Port, but I haven't learned enough JavaScript to get it to work.

I postpone the project until I master virtual servers, or Chrome adds support for Comm Ports on mobile devices.

The page has "Simulate" and "Show All" buttons, just to have a peek of what the page will do once fully functional.

The page is available at:
